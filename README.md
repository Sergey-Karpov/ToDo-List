# 📝🚀📈ToDo-List
ToDo LIst with server&amp;localStorage ability
# Discription
The interface part of the application was created by me. The server part was created by my partners. You can choose whether to save on the server or in the local storage. The to-do list you created is saved when the page is reloaded. You can add newly created tasks to the list, mark them as successfully completed and delete them from the list.
# How to start
You can change the entire contents of the git clone repository or download the ZIP archive of the repository. Start the server, being in the root of the project, you need to go to the todo server folder. After opening the command prompt, run the 'node index' command. Before starting, make sure that you have installed Node.js version 12 or higher. Next, due to the COURSE policy, you need to launch the project from the todo folder using the Live Server plugin in your code editor or any other server.
